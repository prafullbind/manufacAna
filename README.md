# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.


## Analysis

### Mean Flavanoids

Calculated the mean of the Flavanoids property for a given array of wine objects. The TypeScript function `mean` demonstrates how to find the mean of this specific property.

### Median Flavanoids

Calculated the median of the Flavanoids property for a given array of wine objects. The TypeScript function `median` demonstrates how to find the median of this specific property.

### Mode Flavanoids

The `mode` function helps find the mode(s) of a given array. It checks for repeated values and returns either a single mode or an array of modes.

### Mean of (Ash * Hue) / Magnesium

The function `mean` calculates the values of the expression `(Ash * Hue) / Magnesium` for each wine object and determines the mean of those values.

### Median of (Ash * Hue) / Magnesium

The function `median` calculates the values of the expression `(Ash * Hue) / Magnesium` for each wine object and determines the median of those values.

### Mode of (Ash * Hue) / Magnesium

The `mode` function helps find the mode(s) of a given array. It checks for repeated values and returns either a single mode or an array of modes.
